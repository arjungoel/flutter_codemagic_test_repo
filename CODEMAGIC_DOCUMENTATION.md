`Codemagic` is a CI/CD pipeline tool for mobile apps written in front-end technologies and frameworks such as React, React Native, Flutter, Ionic, Cordova, iOS, android etc. 

In order to work with Codemagic, you need to create a `codemagic.yaml` file which resides in the root of the project. `codemagic.yaml` is a highly customizable configuration file for 
setting up your CI/CD pipeline with Codemagic. You have to configure all your workflows in a single file and commit file to version control.

You can authorize integration with several version control platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket etc. The only difference is with github integration the language/framework icon will be
displayed which is not possible directly in the case of gitlab and bitbucket.
